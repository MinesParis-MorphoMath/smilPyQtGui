TO DO

* Images RGB

* Image update - sp.modified()
  - How to handle "modified" signals ?

* Magnifier - with or without overlay ???

* Link manager from images
  - BUG - trying to update original image when linked was closed

* Destroy GUI - from library

* Overlays ???

* Help modal dialog
  - Created - need to add text - the last thing to do

* Save - from menu
  - OK, but ... Image is saved as RGB, even for BW or Gray images
