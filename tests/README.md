# smilPyQtGui demos

## Test/demo Python scripts available :

  - ```single-image.py``` : read an image file, erode it and show both images
  - ```huge.py``` : creates a huge empty image of size 16000x16000 and show it. Surely very slow but it shall work.
  - ```full-demo.py``` : create a number of images allowing to test most package features

## How to launch a test/demo script

To be sure that the demo file will use the just downloaded package and not an eventually already installed, you must use the simple ```launch-demo.sh``` bash script :

```bash
./launch-demo.sh file file ...
```
